In this section show the configuration with kitty (using kitten icat) to show the images, but could be extended to other consoles that support rendering images.

## Nvim + Tmux + Kitty

This is allowed thanks to the Tmux ability to open new panes and use opened panes. In the new pane a console is open and render the Thumbnail, the console must have the ability to render images, in this case kitty with kitten.
